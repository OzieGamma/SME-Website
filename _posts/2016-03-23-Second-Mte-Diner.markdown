Since the first MTE diner was such big success, SUMMIT decided to organize a second dinner during the spring semester of 2016.

Like the first one, it took place at the Atlantide restaurant. 
It was also a great success, with 42 participants, including 1st & 2nd year students, alumni and exchange students. 
The event was a great way to continue the development of the MTE spirit, while gathering around a good meal.
