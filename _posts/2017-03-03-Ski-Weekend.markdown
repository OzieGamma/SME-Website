At the beginning of the spring semester 2017, MTE students got the opportunity to go on a ski weekend. It took place on March 3rd & 4th in Les Diablerets, a ski resort located in the alps in the canton of Vaud. 14 students of the master joined.

This time together was an unique opportunity for the students to exchange different insights from their respective cultures and better know each others.
