As a first event within [ESTIEM][1], 
SME decided to organize an exchange with one of [ESTIEM][1]â€™s local groups in Istanbul, 
LG Yildiz from [Yildiz Technical University](http://www.yildiz.edu.tr/en/).

As part of the exchange, Alexis Frentz and Renaud Lafond-Rive went to Istanbul during the easter break in 2016,
 from March 28th to April 1st. 
It enabled them to discover and dive into a new culture, developing multicultural skills. Alexis and Renaud were hosted by local students, 
 visited Istanbul and the surroundings like Prince Islands as well as museums and Yildiz University. 
 They also discovered Turkish food, tea, coffee and [tavla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tables_(board_game)#Turkey).
 
 The second part of this exchange, took place in Lausanne during the first week of October 2016. 
 Turkish students got to visit and experience Switzerland and its culture.
