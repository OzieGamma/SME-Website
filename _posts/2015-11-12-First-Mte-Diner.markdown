On November 12th, 2015, SUMMIT organized its first event: an MTE Dinner. 
It merged two of SUMMITâ€™s objectives : create an esprit de corps and network with alumni.

This first event took place at the Atlantide restaurant on the EPFL campus.
It gathered both first and second year MTE students. A few alumni and exchange students joined as well around a good meal. 
It was a great success. Students got to learn about opportunities for their after-school life from recent graduates.

This first event was an excellent way to launch the association and to bring MTE students together. 
Since it was really successful, we decided to organize a dinner every semester from now on.
