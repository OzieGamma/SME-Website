In November 2015, the newly formed SME joined [ESTIEM][1] (the organization for European Students in Industrial Engineering & Management),
 and became the local group of [ESTIEM][1] in Lausanne.

[ESTIEM][1] is an organization that aims at fostering students around Europe through different events.
The goal was to bring MTE students in contact with other European students.

As a first step, Oswald Maskens and Alexis Frentz went to the 51th Counsel
 that took place in Vienna in November 2015.
 They had a first taste of the ESTIEMersâ€™ life and created a first contact between SME and [ESTIEM][1].
