At the beginning of the spring semester 2016, MTE students got the opportunity to go on a ski weekend. It took place on February 27th & 28th in Thollon-Les-Mémises, a ski resort just on the other side of lake Geneva. 
16 students from the 1st and 2nd years of the master joined, including 2 exchange students.

We went to the Bon Séjour hotel, where we gathered around regional specialties for a dinner after the first of two sporty days.
